## Problem Statement

The rapid expansion of e-commerce platforms like Amazon has led to a massive increase in sales data. However, businesses often struggle to draw actionable insights from this overwhelming volume of data. A comprehensive sales analysis dashboard is needed to help businesses monitor their performance, identify trends, and optimize their strategies to improve revenue, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

### Project Goals

-  Sales Trend Analysis: Visualize sales performance over time to identify peaks and trends in revenue.
  
-  Product Performance: Analyze individual product sales to highlight bestsellers and underperforming items.
  
-  Customer Insights: Understand customer purchasing behavior through segmentation, average order value, and retention metrics.
  
-  Geographic Distribution: Map sales distribution across regions to identify key markets and potential growth areas.
  
-  Revenue Breakdown: Provide insights into revenue sources by product category, region, and customer type.
  
-  Inventory and Supply Chain Monitoring: Track inventory levels and supply chain performance to minimize stockouts and delays.


## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis has been sourced from Kaggle, providing comprehensive sales data for Amazon.

  - ### Data Preprocessing Involved

      - #### **Data Cleaning**

          - Handle missing values: Identify missing or null values in critical fields like product name, price, sales, etc.Replace missing values with relevant data (mean, median, mode) or remove rows/columns if data is insufficient.
          - Remove duplicates to ensure thereâ€™s no redundancy in the data.
          - Standardize date formats, product names, and other textual data for consistency.  
          - Remove outliers that might skew the analysis, particularly in price or quantity fields.
      - #### **Data Transforamtion**

          - Convert data types: Ensure data is in the correct format (e.g., convert date columns to datetime, numeric columns to integers/floats).
          - Split complex fields like product names into more granular components if needed (e.g., brand, category).
          - Feature engineering: Create new columns (e.g., revenue = price * quantity, profit margin, etc.).Calculate additional insights such as customer lifetime value or product ratings.
          - 
      - #### **Data Aggregation**
  
          - Summarize the data by key dimensions (e.g., product, time period, or region) for deeper analysis.
    
      - #### **Data Validation**

          - Ensure consistency and accuracy of the preprocessed data by validating key metrics, such as total sales and product counts, against expected values.

## Steps Followed 

- Step 1 : Load the dataset onto Power Query Editor.

- Step 2 : Data transformation based on the requirements. Included steps like creating tables like Date, Measures and other metrices.

- Step 3 : Rectified the Relational Model by linking Primary keys, foreign keys and updating table cardinalities.

- Step 5 : Visualized the dashboard structure based on three key questions:
       
        Q1. What type of data is being dealt here?
         Ans. Time series data, categorical, geospatial and hierarchical.

        Q2. What am I trying to communicate here?
         Ans. Comparison between categories over time, depicting compositions.

        Q3. Who is the end-user?
         Ans. The Viewers           


- Step 7 : Created three pages to provide different insights to the viewer:
    
    - #### Overview insights
    - #### Region insights
    - #### Items insights

- Step 8 : The dashboard was complete with all my target requirements being met. Finally, I linked all the pages using Buttons to facilitate smooth navigation.

- Step 9 : Uploaded the entire Dashboard to PowerBI Service.

## Key Insights from Amazon Sales Data Analysis

1. Top-Selling Products
    - A small percentage of products contribute to a large portion of total sales, indicating a clear set of bestsellers.
    - Certain categories like electronics and apparel are consistently driving the highest revenue.
      
2. Geographical Performance
    - Certain regions or countries contribute significantly more to overall revenue, identifying key markets where the business should focus on expansion or marketing efforts.
    - Underperforming regions may reveal opportunities for market penetration strategies or improved logistics.

3. Sales Channel Insights
    - Online sales channels outperform traditional retail channels, with a larger share of customers preferring direct delivery.
    - Subscription-based products (if applicable) show consistent, recurring revenue.
  
4. Inventory and Supply Chain Efficiency
    - Products with frequent stockouts coincide with missed sales opportunities, indicating areas for supply chain improvement.
    - Overstock of slow-moving products results in increased storage costs, suggesting the need for better demand forecasting.

5. Average Order Value (AOV)
    - The average order value is higher for specific customer segments, such as premium customers or those in certain regions.
    - Cross-selling or bundling strategies could be used to increase AOV across lower-value customer segments.

## Challenges Faced During the Amazon Sales Data Analysis Project

1. Data Limitations:

    - Incomplete or Missing Data: Some records had missing values, especially in key fields like product names or sales figures, which required imputation or removal to ensure accuracy.
    - Lack of Granularity: The dataset lacked certain detailed information, such as customer demographics or detailed shipping data, limiting deeper insights into customer behavior and supply chain efficiency.
    - Duplicate Records: There were several instances of duplicate entries, which had to be identified and removed to prevent skewing the analysis.
      
2. Technical Issues:

    - Performance Issues: Due to the size of the dataset, working with large files in Power BI sometimes caused performance slowdowns during data transformation and visualization processes.
    - Complex Calculations: Creating new features like revenue per product, customer lifetime value, or segmenting customers based on purchase behavior involved complex calculations that required additional time and attention to detail.
    - Merging Data Sources: Integrating multiple data sources (if used) such as sales, inventory, and customer data posed challenges in ensuring a seamless merge without data loss or misalignment.
